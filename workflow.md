## Workflow Overview

The COGITO workflow involves a series of steps that start from the VASP calculations and proceed through the tight-binding model construction to the plotting of band structures and densities of states (DOS).

## 1. Static VASP Calculation

Initial calculations are performed using VASP with an indelible uniform grid. This provides the necessary data for generating the tight-binding model.
