## Main Code

The core of COGITO is responsible for generating the basis and constructing the tight-binding (TB) model. This is the foundational step in the workflow, where the primary calculations and basis functions are established.

## Plot Wannier Functions

COGITO provides the functionality to visualize Wannier functions, allowing users to gain insights into the electronic structure and orbital interactions within the material.
