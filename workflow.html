            <h2>Workflow Overview</h2>
            <p>The COGITO workflow involves a series of steps that start from the VASP calculations and proceed through the tight-binding model construction to the plotting of band structures and densities of states (DOS).</p>

            <h2>1. Static VASP Calculation</h2>
            <p>Initial calculations are performed using VASP with an indelible uniform grid. This provides the necessary data for generating the tight-binding model.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>2. COGITO Main</h2>
            <p>The main COGITO code generates the basis and constructs the tight-binding model using the input from the VASP calculations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. COGITO TB</h2>
            <p>COGITO TB module reads all inputs and constructs the tight-binding model. This includes calculating overlaps and plotting the crystal bonds for comparison with the DFT calculations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Band Structure & DOS</h2>
            <p>Using the TB model, the band structure and density of states are calculated. The plots can be projected onto the crystal bonds or displayed as a standard band structure plot.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. Post-processing & Visualization</h2>
            <p>COGITO allows for plotting and post-processing of the results, including projecting the band structure or calculating the projected ICO band structure. This step enables the final analysis and interpretation of the results.</p>
